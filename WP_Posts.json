They isolated bacteria from fecal matter that came from chimpanzees in Tanzania, bonobos in\u00a0the Democratic Republic of the Congo, gorillas in Cameroon, and humans from Connecticut.</p>\n<p>Science <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/07/microbes-our-guts-have-been-us-millions-years\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a> that from the\u00a0samples they collected they compared the DNA sequences of a single rapidly evolving gene\u00a0common in the gut of apes, including humans. The DNA gene sequences were then sorted out into family trees.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>\n<p>The study found that two of the three major gut bacteria in apes and humans arose from an ancient bacteria that lived in\u00a0the guts of our ancestors, suggesting that evolution plays a bigger role than was previously thought in the makeup of our intestinal micro biomes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gut bacteria therefore are not simply acquired from the environment, but have coevolved for millions of years with hominids to help shape our immune systems and development,&#8221; the <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6297/380\" target=\"_blank\">study says</a>.</p>\n<p>To break it down, Science\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/07/microbes-our-guts-have-been-us-millions-years\" target=\"_blank\">says</a> that &#8220;as the different species of apes diverged from this ancestor,\u00a0their gut bacteria also split into new strains, and coevolved in parallel&#8230;to adapt to differences in the diets, habitats, and diseases in the gastrointestinal tracts of their hosts.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It turns out that the bacteria in our guts has existed\u00a0over a span of more than 15 million years of evolution and will continue to be passed on.</p>\n<p><em>To learn more about this study, you can <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/07/microbes-our-guts-have-been-us-millions-years\" target=\"_blank\">read the article from Science</a>.</em></p>\n<div id=\"content-block-markup\"></div>\n"

As the USA and the then USSR developed huge arsenals of nuclear weapons, they and their allies would regularly bring the world close to annihilation, yet &#8211; incredibly &#8211; these highly dangerous military stand-offs often happened in total secrecy: underwater. This eye-opening two-part series tells the compelling story of US, UK and Russian submarine warfare.</p>\n<p>Weapons Of World War II &#8216;<a href=\"http://www.klru.org/schedule/episode/255763/\" target=\"_blank\">Midget Submarines</a>&#8216; &#8211; <em>airs at 4:50 pm<br />\n</em>From attacks on Pearl Harbor and Sydney Harbour, to the British Mediterranean Fleet and the Tirpitz, midget submarines played their part in some of the most gripping stories of the war. This programme recalls the heroic encounters of the men who piloted these midget craft towards their giant quarries.</p>\n<p>Weapons Of World War II &#8216;<a href=\"http://www.klru.org/schedule/episode/255765/\" target=\"_blank\">Aircraft Carriers</a>&#8216; &#8211; <em>airs at 5:15 pm<br />\n</em>Giant aircraft carriers dominated the Pacific War between Japan and the USA. Pearl Harbor was launched to destroy US carriers but failed, while the battle of Midway &#8211; the turning point in the Pacific War &#8211; was won by US carriers delivering tremendous air strikes against Japanese battleships. This programme shows them in dramatic action.</p>\n<p>Weapons Of World War II &#8216;<a href=\"http://www.klru.org/schedule/episode/255768/\" target=\"_blank\">Battleships</a>&#8216; &#8211; <em>airs at 5:40 pm<br />\n</em>At the beginning of World War II, battleships were seen as the key weapon at sea, their huge firepower dominated the waves but over the next six years their vulnerability was exposed by the submarine and aircraft. This programme looks at the great clashes of the ships such as Bismarck and King George V and the way in which the battleships&#8217; role changed to that of shore bombardment and escort work.</p>\n"
